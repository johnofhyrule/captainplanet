Description
You already sort your trash, recycleables, and compost at home (right?!), so here's your chance to show your superior sorting skills online against a friend. Help save Mother Earth by sorting the falling debris!

How to play
Users will land on the loading screen showing the game title, two buttons, and three sorting bins. The three standard sorting bins at the bottom of the screen are:

    - Compost bin (green)
    - Trash bin (black)
    - Recycle bin (blue)

The users will be able to click the How to play button for instructions on how to play. The users will be told that they have to sort three types of debris into the relevant bin for that specific debris. 

When the game has been started the users will be shown a timer, scoreboard, and current round. Earn a point for every debris matched to the correct bin. 

Game Logic
User will click on the debris and click on the correct bin to make a match.

When game has ended the user with the lower score will be shown "TEAM TRUMP" next to their score and the user with the higher score will be shown "TEAM GRETA" next to their score.
